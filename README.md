## Testing <!-- by 张佳琦 (ho0oope) -->

### Test Architecture
The project follows a rigorous testing methodology that includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Independent validation of individual modules
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive API endpoint validation
- **Mock Testing**: Simulation of external services and asynchronous processes
- **Database Tests**: Isolated database operations with clean state management
- **Security Tests**: Authentication and authorization verification

### Test Configuration
All tests utilize a dedicated SQLite instance configured as follows:
```python
import os
from example.models import initialize

# Configure test database
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'sqlite:///./test_environment.db'
initialize(drop_all=True)  # Reset database state before each test suite

# Initialize test client
from starlette.testclient import TestClient
from example.server import app
client = TestClient(app)

Test Best Practices
1.Each test file must initialize a fresh database instance
2.External dependencies should be mocked using unittest.mock
3.Include both success and failure test scenarios
4.Validate all possible HTTP status codes
5.Verify complete response payload structures
6.Use descriptive test names following Given-When-Then pattern
7.Maintain atomic tests with single responsibility
8.Implement proper test cleanup procedures
9.Document test dependencies clearly
10.Include performance benchmarks for critical paths
